## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: Frontend Not Displaying Content ❌➡️✅

**Issue:**
- User could see navigation bar but all page content was blank
- No visible text or data on any page
- Navigation worked but pages showed nothing

**Investigation:**
- Checked browser console - Found JavaScript error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'before')"
- Issue was with svelte-routing library
- Router component wasn't initializing properly

**Root Cause:**
- `svelte-routing` had compatibility issues in production environment
- Router context not being established correctly
- Library had known issues with server-side rendering patterns

**Solution:**
1. Switched from `svelte-routing` to `svelte-spa-router`
2. Changed to hash-based routing (`#/` instead of `/`)
3. Updated all Link components to use regular `<a href="#/path">` tags
4. Simplified routing configuration

**Result:**
✅ Content now displays perfectly
✅ Navigation works without page refresh
✅ No more JavaScript errors
✅ Stable, production-ready routing

### Problem 2: API Connection from External IP ❌➡️✅

**Issue:**
- Frontend calling `http://localhost:42069` from browser
- Didn't work when accessing from different machine (192.168.0.102:6969)
- Browser trying to connect to its own localhost, not the server

**Root Cause:**
- API base URL was hardcoded as `localhost`
- Browser interprets localhost as its own machine
- Doesn't work across network

**Solution:**
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
  ? 'http://localhost:42069'
  : `http://${window.location.hostname}:42069`;
```

**Result:**
✅ API works from any IP address
✅ Works on local network
✅ Dynamic URL based on browser location
✅ No hardcoded values

### Problem 3: Settings Validation Not Preventing Bad Configurations ❌➡️✅

**Issue:**
- Users could set threads > CPU cores
- Could allocate more RAM than available
- Could set invalid Stockfish paths
- No warnings or errors

**Root Cause:**
- Settings endpoint had no validation
- Saved values directly without checking
- No integration with system resource detection

**Solution:**
1. Created validation service (`system_resources.py`)
2. Integrated validation in `PUT /api/settings` endpoint
3. Check all settings against system capabilities
4. Return detailed error messages

**Validation Rules Implemented:**
- Threads: Must be 1 to logical_cores
- Hash: Must be 16 MB to available_memory
- Stockfish path: Must exist and be executable
- Analysis depth: 1-50
- Analysis time: 100-60000 ms

**Result:**
✅ Invalid configurations rejected
✅ Clear error messages
✅ System stability protected
✅ Users guided to valid values

### Problem 4: No Onboarding for New Users ❌➡️✅

**Issue:**
- New users didn't know where to start
- No guidance on optimal settings
- Had to manually configure everything
- Unclear what values to use

**Root Cause:**
- No first-time user detection
- No setup wizard
- No hardware-aware recommendations

**Solution:**
1. Created complete 4-step setup wizard
2. Auto-detects first-time users (no Chess.com username)
3. Fetches system resources
4. Shows recommended settings with explanations
5. Allows customization
6. Saves everything automatically

**Result:**
✅ Smooth onboarding experience
✅ Optimal settings configured automatically
✅ Users understand their configuration
✅ Professional first impression

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### Challenge 1: Svelte Routing in Production
**Problem:** svelte-routing causing runtime errors
**Solution:** Migrated to svelte-spa-router with hash routing
**Impact:** Stable routing, better browser compatibility

### Challenge 2: Cross-Network API Access
**Problem:** API URL hardcoded to localhost
**Solution:** Dynamic URL based on window.location.hostname
**Impact:** Works across entire network

### Challenge 3: Docker Container Rebuilds
**Problem:** User wanted specific docker-compose.yml path usage
**Solution:** Always use full path: `/root/docker/local-chess-analyzer/docker-compose.yml`
**Impact:** Consistent, predictable deployments

### Challenge 4: CSS Not Applying / White Text Issue
**Problem:** Initially thought CSS wasn't loading, content appeared blank
**Solution:** Was actually JavaScript routing error, not CSS
**Impact:** Proper diagnosis led to correct fix

### Challenge 5: Settings Validation Architecture
**Problem:** Where to validate - frontend or backend?
**Solution:** Both - frontend for UX, backend for security
**Impact:** Robust validation, good user experience
